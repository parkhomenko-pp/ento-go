## Game Menu
Once a game is started, you will enter the Game menu where you can make moves and see the current state of the board.
The first to move is the person who created the game. They play with black pieces.
To make a move, send the bot a message with the number of the square where you want to place your piece.
After the move, a message is sent to the opponent informing them that a move has been made and it is now their turn.
